# algo-study-group
Wouldn't it be nice if we could share our code on a repository and get practice with github while we're at it? ðŸ¤©

The purpose of the algo study group is to become an algo ninja, but also to create the habit of trying and doing algorithms so that we get 1% better each time and eventually get better and better to be 1000% better.

On your own we should read up on what this is all about. Please add resources to the resources folder through a pull request or be a contributor and merge yours info with what's there.


## fun github instructions

### Fork this repository

if you do this, you can propose answers and an ðŸ‘¤ admin (anyone can be an admin, let me know) approve them. So, we can get a compilation of all our answers.

- Step 1: fork this repository
- Step 2: Clone the fork to your local drive
- Step 3: Make changes and update your fork
- Step 4:  when you open your fork it will tell you that there are changes that are different from the main file. Click on Contribute
- Step 4: create a pull request to merge the changes you've made and add details of what it is

Here's a good tutorial on it [Making a pull request on github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects)

The fork is kind of like a branch, but for the repository not just a branch [forking tutorial by TheCodex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT8KGYVurIU)

### Or Make a branch

- Step 1: make a branch
- Step 2: clone that branch to your computer
- Step 3: make changes
- Step 4: contribute those changes through a pull request. On a branch you can also merge it yourself if you have the permissions.

On a branch you can work on the document while others are working too and then pull and merge when you are done.

### push issues

- What happens when the remote main is updated and your local code wasn't updated?
- `git pull` what is on the remote repository
- `git merge` will show you all the changes that you choose to stay or go. [quick merge tutorial here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmKdodJU-js)
- then add, commit and push per usual
